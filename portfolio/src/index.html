  <h2 id ="about">About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello there, my name is Louis Comeaux. I am 25 years old and was born in San Diego, CA. I graduated College from the University of Arizona with a bachelors degree in Political Science & Business Administration in 2019. After graduation, I was working as an Area Manager at Amazon when I was first introduced to programming by a friend of mine and was intrigued ever since!  I since returned to college to study Computer Science and am currently working as an Engineer intern for the Colorado Department of Transportation. I am eager to gain employment as a developer and look forward to contributing to team.</p>
